<h1>JOHN BULL ON THE GUADALQUIVIR.</h1>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> an Englishman, living, as all
Englishman should do, in England, and my wife would not, I think,
be well pleased were any one to insinuate that she were other
than an Englishwoman; but in the circumstances of my marriage I
became connected with the south of Spain, and the narrative which
I am to tell requires that I should refer to some of those
details.</p>
<p>The Pomfrets and Daguilars have long been in trade together in
this country, and one of the partners has usually resided at
Seville for the sake of the works which the firm there
possesses.&nbsp; My father, James Pomfret, lived there for ten
years before his marriage; and since that and up to the present
period, old Mr. Daguilar has always been on the spot.&nbsp; He
was, I believe, born in Spain, but he came very early to England;
he married an English wife, and his sons had been educated
exclusively in England.&nbsp; His only daughter, Maria Daguilar,
did not pass so large a proportion of her early life in this
country, but she came to us for a visit at the age of seventeen,
and when she returned I made up my mind that I most assuredly
would go after her.&nbsp; So I did, and she is now sitting on the
other side of the fireplace with a legion of small linen
habiliments in a huge basket by her side.</p>
<p>I felt, at the first, that there was something lacking to make
my cup of love perfectly delightful.&nbsp; It was very sweet, but
there was wanting that flower of romance which is generally added
to the heavenly draught by a slight admixture of
opposition.&nbsp; I feared that the path of my true love would
run too smooth.&nbsp; When Maria came to our house, my mother and
elder sister seemed to be quite willing that I should be
continually alone with her; and she had not been there ten days
before my father, by chance, remarked that there was nothing old
Mr. Daguilar valued so highly as a thorough feeling of intimate
alliance between the two families which had been so long
connected in trade.&nbsp; I was never told that Maria was to be
my wife, but I felt that the same thing was done without words;
and when, after six weeks of somewhat elaborate attendance upon
her, I asked her to be Mrs. John Pomfret, I had no more fear of a
refusal, or even of hesitation on her part, than I now have when
I suggest to my partner some commercial transaction of undoubted
advantage.</p>
<p>But Maria, even at that age, had about her a quiet sustained
decision of character quite unlike anything I had seen in English
girls.&nbsp; I used to hear, and do still hear, how much more
flippant is the education of girls in France and Spain than in
England; and I know that this is shown to be the result of many
causes&mdash;the Roman Catholic religion being, perhaps, chief
offender; but, nevertheless, I rarely see in one of our own young
women the same power of a self-sustained demeanour as I meet on
the Continent.&nbsp; It goes no deeper than the demeanour, people
say.&nbsp; I can only answer that I have not found that
shallowness in my own wife.</p>
<p>Miss Daguilar replied to me that she was not prepared with an
answer; she had only known me six weeks, and wanted more time to
think about it; besides, there was one in her own country with
whom she would wish to consult.&nbsp; I knew she had no mother;
and as for consulting old Mr. Daguilar on such a subject, that
idea, I knew, could not have troubled her.&nbsp; Besides, as I
afterwards learned, Mr. Daguilar had already proposed the
marriage to his partner exactly as he would have proposed a
division of assets.&nbsp; My mother declared that Maria was a
foolish chit&mdash;in which by-the-bye she showed her entire
ignorance of Miss Daguilar&rsquo;s character; my eldest sister
begged that no constraint might he put on the young lady&rsquo;s
inclinations&mdash;which provoked me to assert that the young
lady&rsquo;s inclinations were by no means opposed to my own; and
my father, in the coolest manner suggested that the matter might
stand over for twelve months, and that I might then go to
Seville, and see about it!&nbsp; Stand over for twelve
months!&nbsp; Would not Maria, long before that time, have been
snapped up and carried off by one of those inordinately rich
Spanish grandees who are still to be met with occasionally in
Andalucia?</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s dictum, however, had gone forth; and Maria,
in the calmest voice, protested that she thought it very
wise.&nbsp; I should be less of a boy by that time, she said,
smiling on me, but driving wedges between every fibre of my body
as she spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; I said,
proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate, I am not so much of a boy that
I shall forget you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And, John, you still have
the trade to learn,&rdquo; she added, with her deliciously
foreign intonation&mdash;speaking very slowly, but with perfect
pronunciation.&nbsp; The trade to learn!&nbsp; However, I said
not a word, but stalked out of the room, meaning to see her no
more before she went.&nbsp; But I could not resist attending on
her in the hall as she started; and, when she took leave of us,
she put her face up to be kissed by me, as she did by my father,
and seemed to receive as much emotion from one embrace as from
the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go out by the packet of the
1st April,&rdquo; said my father, speaking of me as though I were
a bale of goods.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! that will be so nice,&rdquo;
said Maria, settling her dress in the carriage; &ldquo;the
oranges will be ripe for him then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 17th April I did sail, and felt still very like a bale
of goods.&nbsp; I had received one letter from her, in which she
merely stated that her papa would have a room ready for me on my
arrival; and, in answer to that, I had sent an epistle somewhat
longer, and, as I then thought, a little more to the
purpose.&nbsp; Her turn of mind was more practical than mine, and
I must confess my belief that she did not appreciate my
poetry.</p>
<p>I landed at Cadiz, and was there joined by an old family
friend, one of the very best fellows that ever lived.&nbsp; He
was to accompany me up as far as Seville; and, as he had lived
for a year or two at Xeres, was supposed to be more Spanish
almost than a Spaniard.&nbsp; His name was Johnson, and he was in
the wine trade; and whether for travelling or whether for staying
at home&mdash;whether for paying you a visit in your own house,
or whether for entertaining you in his&mdash;there never was (and
I am prepared to maintain there never will be) a stancher friend,
choicer companion, or a safer guide than Thomas Johnson.&nbsp;
Words cannot produce a eulogium sufficient for his merits.&nbsp;
But, as I have since learned, he was not quite so Spanish as I
had imagined.&nbsp; Three years among the bodegas of Xeres had
taught him, no doubt, to appreciate the exact twang of a good,
dry sherry; but not, as I now conceive, the exactest flavour of
the true Spanish character.&nbsp; I was very lucky, however, in
meeting such a friend, and now reckon him as one of the stanchest
allies of the house of Pomfret, Daguilar, and Pomfret.</p>
<p>He met me at Cadiz, took me about the town, which appeared to
me to be of no very great interest;&mdash;though the young ladies
were all very well.&nbsp; But, in this respect, I was then a
Stoic, till such time as I might be able to throw myself at the
feet of her whom I was ready to proclaim the most lovely of all
the Dulcineas of Andalucia.&nbsp; He carried me up by boat and
railway to Xeres; gave me a most terrific headache, by dragging
me out into the glare of the sun, after I had tasted some half a
dozen different wines, and went through all the ordinary
hospitalities.&nbsp; On the next day we returned to Puerto, and
from thence getting across to St. Lucar and Bonanza, found
ourselves on the banks of the Guadalquivir, and took our places
in the boat for Seville.&nbsp; I need say but little to my
readers respecting that far-famed river.&nbsp; Thirty years ago
we in England generally believed that on its banks was to be
found a pure elysium of pastoral beauty; that picturesque
shepherds and lovely maidens here fed their flocks in fields of
asphodel; that the limpid stream ran cool and crystal over bright
stones and beneath perennial shade; and that every thing on the
Guadalquivir was as lovely and as poetical as its name.&nbsp;
Now, it is pretty widely known that no uglier river oozes down to
its bourn in the sea through unwholesome banks of low mud.&nbsp;
It is brown and dirty; ungifted by any scenic advantage; margined
for miles upon miles by huge, flat, expansive fields, in which
cattle are reared,&mdash;the bulls wanted for the bullfights
among other; and birds of prey sit constant on the shore,
watching for the carcases of such as die.&nbsp; Such are the
charms of the golden Guadalquivir.</p>
<p>At first we were very dull on board that steamer.&nbsp; I
never found myself in a position in which there was less to
do.&nbsp; There was a nasty smell about the little boat which
made me almost ill; every turn in the river was so exactly like
the last, that we might have been standing still; there was no
amusement except eating, and that, when once done, was not of a
kind to make an early repetition desirable.&nbsp; Even Johnson
was becoming dull, and I began to doubt whether I was so desirous
as I once had been to travel the length and breadth of all
Spain.&nbsp; But about noon a little incident occurred which did
for a time remove some of our tedium.&nbsp; The boat had stopped
to take in passengers on the river; and, among others, a man had
come on board dressed in a fashion that, to my eyes, was equally
strange and picturesque.&nbsp; Indeed, his appearance was so
singular, that I could not but regard him with care, though I
felt at first averse to stare at a fellow-passenger on account of
his clothes.&nbsp; He was a man of about fifty, but as active
apparently as though not more than twenty five; he was of low
stature, but of admirable make; his hair was just becoming
grizzled, but was short and crisp and well cared for; his face
was prepossessing, having a look of good humour added to
courtesy, and there was a pleasant, soft smile round his mouth
which ingratiated one at the first sight.&nbsp; But it was his
dress rather than his person which attracted attention.&nbsp; He
wore the ordinary Andalucian cap&mdash;of which such hideous
parodies are now making themselves common in England&mdash;but
was not contented with the usual ornament of the double
tuft.&nbsp; The cap was small, and jaunty; trimmed with silk
velvet&mdash;as is common here with men careful to adorn their
persons; but this man&rsquo;s cap was finished off with a
jewelled button and golden filigree work.&nbsp; He was dressed in
a short jacket with a stand up collar; and that also was covered
with golden buttons and with golden button-holes.&nbsp; It was
all gilt down the front, and all lace down the back.&nbsp; The
rows of buttons were double; and those of the more backward row
hung down in heavy pendules.&nbsp; His waistcoat was of coloured
silk&mdash;very pretty to look at; and ornamented with a small
sash, through which gold threads were worked.&nbsp; All the
buttons of his breeches also were of gold; and there were gold
tags to all the button-holes.&nbsp; His stockings were of the
finest silk, and clocked with gold from the knee to the
ankle.</p>
<p>Dress any Englishman in such a garb and he will at once give
you the idea of a hog in armour.&nbsp; In the first place he will
lack the proper spirit to carry it off, and in the next place the
motion of his limbs will disgrace the ornaments they bear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And so best,&rdquo; most Englishmen will say.&nbsp; Very
likely; and, therefore, let no Englishman try it.&nbsp; But my
Spaniard did not look at like a hog in armour.&nbsp; He walked
slowly down the plank into the boat, whistling lowly but very
clearly a few bars from a opera tune.&nbsp; It was plain to see
that he was master of himself, of his ornaments, and of his
limbs.&nbsp; He had no appearance of thinking that men were
looking at him, or of feeling that he was beauteous in his
attire;&mdash;nothing could be more natural than his foot-fall,
or the quiet glance of his cheery gray eye.&nbsp; He walked up to
the captain, who held the helm, and lightly raised his hand to
his cap.&nbsp; The captain, taking one hand from the wheel, did
the same, and then the stranger, turning his back to the stern of
the vessel, and fronting down the river with his face, continued
to whistle slowly, clearly, and in excellent time.&nbsp; Grand as
were his clothes they were no burden on his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he?&rdquo; said I, going up to my friend
Johnson with a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been looking at him,&rdquo; said
Johnson&mdash;which was true enough; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a &mdash;
an uncommonly good-looking fellow, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Particularly so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and got up quite
irrespective of expense.&nbsp; Is he a&mdash;a&mdash;a gentleman,
now, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those things are so different in Spain that
it&rsquo;s almost impossible to make an Englishman understand
them.&nbsp; One learns to know all this sort of people by being
with them in the country, but one can&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; exactly.&nbsp; Are they real gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I dare say they are.&nbsp; They sometimes
have them silver gilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite a common thing, then, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly; that&mdash;Ah! yes; I see! of
course.&nbsp; He is a torero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mayo.&nbsp; I will explain it all to you.&nbsp; You
will see them about in all places, and you will get used to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t seen one other as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and they are not all so gay as this, nor so new in
their finery, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is a torero?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a torero is a man engaged in
bull-fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he is a matador, is he?&rdquo; said I, looking at
him with more than all my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly that;&mdash;not of necessity.&nbsp; He
is probably a mayo.&nbsp; A fellow that dresses himself smart for
fairs, and will be seen hanging about with the
bull-fighters.&nbsp; What would be a sporting fellow in
England&mdash;only he won&rsquo;t drink and curse like a low man
on the turf there.&nbsp; Come, shall we go and speak to
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to him,&rdquo; said I, diffident of
my Spanish.&nbsp; I had received lessons in England from Maria
Daguilar; but six weeks is little enough for making love, let
alone the learning of a foreign language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do the talking.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
find the language easy enough before long.&nbsp; It soon becomes
the same as English to you, when you live among
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then Johnson, walking up to the stranger,
accosted him with that good-natured familiarity with which a
thoroughly nice fellow always opens a conversation with his
inferior.&nbsp; Of course I could not understand the words which
were exchanged; but it was clear enough that the
&ldquo;mayo&rdquo; took the address in good part, and was
inclined to be communicative and social.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all of pure gold,&rdquo; said Johnson, turning
to me after a minute, making as he spoke a motion with his head
to show the importance of the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they indeed?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where on
earth did a fellow like that get them?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon
Johnson again returned to his conversation with the man.&nbsp;
After another minute he raised his hand, and began to finger the
button on the shoulder; and to aid him in doing so, the man of
the bull-ring turned a little on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are wonderfully well made,&rdquo; said Johnson,
talking to me, and still fingering the button.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
are manufactured, he says, at Osuna, and he tells me that they
make them better there than anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what the whole set would cost?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;An enormous deal of money for a fellow like him,
I should think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over twelve ounces,&rdquo; said Johnson, having asked
the question; &ldquo;and that will be more than forty
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an uncommon ass he must be!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>As Johnson by this time was very closely scrutinising the
whole set of ornaments I thought I might do so also, and going up
close to our friend, I too began to handle the buttons and tags
on the other side.&nbsp; Nothing could have been more
good-humoured than he was&mdash;so much so that I was emboldened
to hold up his arm that I might see the cut of his coat, to take
off his cap and examine the make, to stuff my finger in beneath
his sash, and at last to kneel down while I persuaded him to hold
up his legs that I might look to the clocking.&nbsp; The fellow
was thorough good-natured, and why should I not indulge my
curiosity?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll upset him if you don&rsquo;t take
care,&rdquo; said Johnson; for I had got fast hold of him by one
ankle, and was determined to finish the survey completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;a
bull-fighting chap can surely stand on one leg.&nbsp; But what I
wonder at is, how on earth he can afford it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon Johnson again began to interrogate him in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he has got no children,&rdquo; said Johnson,
having received a reply, &ldquo;and that as he has nobody but
himself to look after, he is able to allow himself such little
luxuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him that I say he would be better with a wife and
couple of babies,&rdquo; said I&mdash;and Johnson
interpreted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that he&rsquo;ll think of it some of these
days, when he finds that the supply of fools in the world is
becoming short,&rdquo; said Johnson.</p>
<p>We had nearly done with him now; but after regaining my feet,
I addressed myself once more to the heavy pendules, which hung
down almost under his arm.&nbsp; I lifted one of these, meaning
to feel its weight between my fingers; but unfortunately I gave a
lurch, probably through the motion of the boat, and still holding
by the button, tore it almost off from our friend&rsquo;s
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry,&rdquo; I said, in broad English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It do not matter at all,&rdquo; he said, bowing, and
speaking with equal plainness.&nbsp; And then, taking a knife
from his pocket, he cut the pendule off, leaving a bit of torn
cloth on the side of his jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, I am quite unhappy,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;but I always am so awkward.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon he
bowed low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I make it right?&rdquo; said I, bringing
out my purse.</p>
<p>He lifted his hand, and I saw that it was small and white; he
lifted it and gently put it upon my purse, smiling sweetly as he
did so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, no, se&ntilde;or; thank you,
no.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, bowing to us both, he walked away down
into the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word he is a deuced well-mannered
fellow,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have offered him money,&rdquo; said
Johnson; &ldquo;a Spaniard does not like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you could do nothing without money in
this country.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t every one take
bribes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes; that is a different thing; but not the price
of a button.&nbsp; By Jove! he understood English, too.&nbsp; Did
you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I called him an ass!&nbsp; I hope he
doesn&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no; he won&rsquo;t think anything about it,&rdquo;
said Johnson.&nbsp; &ldquo;That sort of fellows
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I dare say we shall see him in the bull-ring
next Sunday, and then we&rsquo;ll make all right with a glass of
lemonade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so our adventure ended with the man of the gold
ornaments.&nbsp; I was sorry that I had spoken English before him
so heedlessly, and resolved that I would never be guilty of such
gaucherie again.&nbsp; But, then, who would think that a Spanish
bull-fighter would talk a foreign language?&nbsp; I was sorry,
also, that I had torn his coat; it had looked so awkward; and
sorry again that I had offered the man money.&nbsp; Altogether I
was a little ashamed of myself; but I had too much to look
forward to at Seville to allow any heaviness to remain long at my
heart; and before I had arrived at the marvellous city I had
forgotten both him and his buttons.</p>
<p>Nothing could be nicer than the way in which I was welcomed at
Mr. Daguilar&rsquo;s house, or more kind&mdash;I may almost say
affectionate&mdash;than Maria&rsquo;s manner to me.&nbsp; But it
was too affectionate; and I am not sure that I should not have
liked my reception better had she been more diffident in her
tone, and less inclined to greet me with open warmth.&nbsp; As it
was, she again gave me her cheek to kiss, in her father&rsquo;s
presence, and called me dear John, and asked me specially after
some rabbits which I had kept at home merely for a younger
sister; and then it seemed as though she were in no way
embarrassed by the peculiar circumstances of our position.&nbsp;
Twelve months since I had asked her to be my wife, and now she
was to give me an answer; and yet she was as assured in her gait,
and as serenely joyous in her tone, as though I were a brother
just returned from college.&nbsp; It could not be that she meant
to refuse me, or she would not smile on me and be so loving; but
I could almost have found it in my heart to wish that she
would.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is quite possible,&rdquo; said I to
myself, &ldquo;that I may not be found so ready for this family
bargain.&nbsp; A love that is to be had like a bale of goods is
not exactly the love to suit my taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then,
when I met her again in the morning I could no more have
quarrelled with her than I could have flown.</p>
<p>I was inexpressibly charmed with the whole city, and
especially with the house in which Mr. Daguilar lived.&nbsp; It
opened from the corner of a narrow, unfrequented street&mdash;a
corner like an elbow&mdash;and, as seen from the exterior, there
was nothing prepossessing to recommend it; but the outer door led
by a short hall or passage to an inner door or grille, made of
open ornamental iron-work, and through that we entered a court,
or patio, as they I called it.&nbsp; Nothing could be more lovely
or deliciously cool than was this small court.&nbsp; The building
on each side was covered by trellis-work; and beautiful creepers,
vines, and parasite flowers, now in the full magnificence of the
early summer, grew up and clustered round the windows.&nbsp;
Every inch of wall was covered, so that none of the glaring
whitewash wounded the eye.&nbsp; In the four corners of the patio
were four large orange-trees, covered with fruit.&nbsp; I would
not say a word in special praise of these, remembering that
childish promise she had made on my behalf.&nbsp; In the middle
of the court there was a fountain, and round about on the marble
floor there were chairs, and here and there a small table, as
though the space were really a portion of the house.&nbsp; It was
here that we used to take our cup of coffee and smoke our
cigarettes, I and old Mr. Daguilar, while Maria sat by, not only
approving, but occasionally rolling for me the thin paper round
the fragrant weed with her taper fingers.&nbsp; Beyond the patio
was an open passage or gallery, filled also with flowers in pots;
and then, beyond this, one entered the drawing-room of the
house.&nbsp; It was by no means a princely palace or mansion, fit
for the owner of untold wealth.&nbsp; The rooms were not over
large nor very numerous; but the most had been made of a small
space, and everything had been done to relieve the heat of an
almost tropical sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty, is it not?&rdquo; she said, as she took
me through it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish we
could live in such houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they would not do at all for dear old fat, cold,
cozy England.&nbsp; You are quite different, you know, in
everything from us in the south; more phlegmatic, but then so
much steadier.&nbsp; The men and the houses are all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can hardly tell why, but even this wounded me.&nbsp; It
seemed to me as though she were inclined to put into one and the
same category things English, dull, useful, and solid; and that
she was disposed to show a sufficient appreciation for such
necessaries of life, though she herself had another and inner
sense&mdash;a sense keenly alive to the poetry of her own
southern chime; and that I, as being English, was to have no
participation in this latter charm.&nbsp; An English husband
might do very well, the interests of the firm might make such an
arrangement desirable, such a mariage de convenance&mdash;so I
argued to myself&mdash;might be quite compatible with&mdash;with
heaven only knows what delights of superterrestial romance, from
which I, as being an English thick-headed lump of useful coarse
mortality, was to be altogether debarred.&nbsp; She had spoken to
me of oranges, and having finished the survey of the house, she
offered me some sweet little cakes.&nbsp; It could not be that of
such things were the thoughts which lay undivulged beneath the
clear waters of those deep black eyes&mdash;undivulged to me,
though no one else could have so good a right to read those
thoughts!&nbsp; It could not be that that noble brow gave index
of a mind intent on the trade of which she spoke so often!&nbsp;
Words of other sort than any that had been vouchsafed to me must
fall at times from the rich curves of that perfect month.</p>
<p>So felt I then, pining for something to make me unhappy.&nbsp;
Ah, me!&nbsp; I know all about it now, and am content.&nbsp; But
I wish that some learned pundit would give us a good definition
of romance, would describe in words that feeling with which our
hearts are so pestered when we are young, which makes us sigh for
we know not what, and forbids us to be contented with what God
sends us.&nbsp; We invest female beauty with impossible
attributes, and are angry because our women have not the
spiritualised souls of angels, anxious as we are that they should
also be human in the flesh.&nbsp; A man looks at her he would
love as at a distant landscape in a mountainous land.&nbsp; The
peaks are glorious with more than the beauty of earth and rock
and vegetation.&nbsp; He dreams of some mysterious grandeur of
design which tempts him on under the hot sun, and over the sharp
rock, till he has reached the mountain goal which he had set
before him.&nbsp; But when there, he finds that the beauty is
well-nigh gone, and as for that delicious mystery on which his
soul had fed, it has vanished for ever.</p>
<p>I know all about it now, and am, as I said, content.&nbsp;
Beneath those deep black eyes there lay a well of love, good,
honest, homely love, love of father and husband and children that
were to come&mdash;of that love which loves to see the loved ones
prospering in honesty.&nbsp; That noble brow&mdash;for it is
noble; I am unchanged in that opinion, and will go unchanged to
my grave&mdash;covers thoughts as to the welfare of many, and an
intellect fitted to the management of a household, of servants,
namely, and children, and perchance a husband.&nbsp; That mouth
can speak words of wisdom, of very useful wisdom&mdash;though of
poetry it has latterly uttered little that was original.&nbsp;
Poetry and romance!&nbsp; They are splendid mountain views seen
in the distance.&nbsp; So let men be content to see them, and not
attempt to tread upon the fallacious heather of the mystic
hills.</p>
<p>In the first week of my sojourn in Seville I spoke no word of
overt love to Maria, thinking, as I confess, to induce her
thereby to alter her mode of conduct to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
knows that I have come here to make love to her&mdash;to repeat
my offer; and she will at any rate be chagrined if I am slow to
do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it had no effect.&nbsp; At home my mother
was rather particular about her table, and Maria&rsquo;s greatest
efforts seemed to be used in giving me as nice dinners as we gave
her.&nbsp; In those days I did not care a straw about my dinner,
and so I took an opportunity of telling her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear
me,&rdquo; said she, looking at me almost with grief, &ldquo;do
you not?&nbsp; What a pity!&nbsp; And do you not like music
either.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes, I adore it,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; I felt sure at the time that had I been born in
her own sunny clime, she would never have talked to me about
eating.&nbsp; But that was my mistake.</p>
<p>I used to walk out with her about the city, seeing all that is
there of beauty and magnificence.&nbsp; And in what city is there
more that is worth the seeing?&nbsp; At first this was very
delightful to me, for I felt that I was blessed with a privilege
that would not be granted to any other man.&nbsp; But its value
soon fell in my eyes, for others would accost her, and walk on
the other side, talking to her in Spanish, as though I hardly
existed, or were a servant there for her protection.&nbsp; And I
was not allowed to take her arm, and thus to appropriate her, as
I should have done in England.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, John,&rdquo; she
said, with the sweetest, prettiest smile, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
do that here; only when people are married.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
made this allusion to married life out, openly, with no slightest
tremor on her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg pardon,&rdquo; said I, drawing back my hand,
and feeling angry with myself for not being fully acquainted with
all the customs of a foreign country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not beg pardon,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;when
we were in England we always walked so.&nbsp; It is just a
custom, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then I saw her drop her large
dark eyes to the ground, and bow gracefully in answer to some
salute.</p>
<p>I looked round, and saw that we had been joined by a young
cavalier,&mdash;a Spanish nobleman, as I saw at once; a man with
jet black hair, and a straight nose, and a black moustache, and
patent leather boots, very slim and very tall, and&mdash;though I
would not confess it then&mdash;uncommonly handsome.&nbsp; I
myself am inclined to be stout, my hair is light, my nose broad,
I have no hair on my upper lip, and my whiskers are rough and
uneven.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could punch your head though, my fine
fellow,&rdquo; said I to myself, when I saw that he placed
himself at Maria&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;and think very little of
the achievement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wretch went on with us round the plaza for some quarter of
an hour talking Spanish with the greatest fluency, and she was
every whit as fluent.&nbsp; Of course I could not understand a
word that they said.&nbsp; Of all positions that a man can
occupy, I think that that is about the most uncomfortable; and I
cannot say that, even up to this day, I have quite forgiven her
for that quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go in,&rdquo; said I, unable to bear my
feelings, and preparing to leave her.&nbsp; &ldquo;The heat is
unendurable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, John, why did you not speak before?&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You cannot leave me here, you know, as I
am in your charge; but I will go with you almost
directly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she finished her conversation
with the Spaniard, speaking with an animation she had never
displayed in her conversations with me.</p>
<p>It had been agreed between us for two or three days before
this, that we were to rise early on the following morning for the
sake of ascending the tower of the cathedral, and visiting the
Giralda, as the iron figure is called, which turns upon a pivot
on the extreme summit.&nbsp; We had often wandered together up
and down the long dark gloomy aisle of the stupendous building,
and had, together, seen its treasury of art; but as yet we had
not performed the task which has to be achieved by all visitors
to Seville; and in order that we might have a clear view over the
surrounding country, and not be tormented by the heat of an
advanced sun, we had settled that we would ascend the Giralda
before breakfast.</p>
<p>And now, as I walked away from the plaza towards Mr.
Daguilar&rsquo;s house, with Maria by my side, I made up my mind
that I would settle my business during this visit to the
cathedral.&nbsp; Yes, and I would so manage the settlement that
there should be no doubt left as to my intentions and my own
ideas.&nbsp; I would not be guilty of shilly-shally conduct; I
would tell her frankly what I felt and what I thought, and would
make her understand that I did not desire her hand if I could not
have her heart.&nbsp; I did not value the kindness of her manner,
seeing that that kindness sprung from indifference rather than
passion; and so I would declare to her.&nbsp; And I would ask
her, also, who was this young man with whom she was
intimate&mdash;for whom all her volubility and energy of tone
seemed to be employed?&nbsp; She had told me once that it behoved
her to consult a friend in Seville as to the expediency of her
marriage with me.&nbsp; Was this the friend whom she had wished
to consult?&nbsp; If so, she need not trouble herself.&nbsp;
Under such circumstances I should decline the connection!&nbsp;
And I resolved that I would find out how this might be.&nbsp; A
man who proposes to take a woman to his bosom as his wife, has a
right to ask for information&mdash;ay, and to receive it
too.&nbsp; It flashed upon my mind at this moment that Donna
Maria was well enough inclined to come to me as my wife, but
&mdash;.&nbsp; I could hardly define the &ldquo;buts&rdquo; to
myself, for there were three or four of them.&nbsp; Why did she
always speak to me in a tone of childish affection, as though I
were a schoolboy home for the holidays?&nbsp; I would have all
this out with her on the tower on the following morning, standing
under the Giralda.</p>
<p>On that morning we met together in the patio, soon after five
o&rsquo;clock, and started for the cathedral.&nbsp; She looked
beautiful, with her black mantilla over her head, and with black
gloves on, and her black morning silk dress&mdash;beautiful,
composed, and at her ease, as though she were well satisfied to
undertake this early morning walk from feelings of good
nature&mdash;sustained, probably, by some under-current of a
deeper sentiment.&nbsp; Well; I would know all about it before I
returned to her father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>There hardly stands, as I think, on the earth, a building more
remarkable than the cathedral of Seville, and hardly one more
grand.&nbsp; Its enormous size; its gloom and darkness; the
richness of ornamentation in the details, contrasted with the
severe simplicity of the larger outlines; the variety of its
architecture; the glory of its paintings; and the wondrous
splendour of its metallic decoration, its altar-friezes, screens,
rails, gates, and the like, render it, to my mind, the first in
interest among churches.&nbsp; It has not the coloured glass of
Chartres, or the marble glory of Milan, or such a forest of
aisles as Antwerp, or so perfect a hue in stone as Westminster,
nor in mixed beauty of form and colour does it possess anything
equal to the choir of Cologne; but, for combined magnificence and
awe-compelling grandeur, I regard it as superior to all other
ecclesiastical edifices.</p>
<p>It is its deep gloom with which the stranger is so greatly
struck on his first entrance.&nbsp; In a region so hot as the
south of Spain, a cool interior is a main object with the
architect, and this it has been necessary to effect by the
exclusion of light; consequently the church is dark, mysterious,
and almost cold.&nbsp; On the morning in question, as we entered,
it seemed to be filled with gloom, and the distant sound of a
slow footstep here and there beyond the transept inspired one
almost with awe.&nbsp; Maria, when she first met me, had begun to
talk with her usual smile, offering me coffee and a biscuit
before I started.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never eat biscuit,&rdquo; I
said, with almost a severe tone, as I turned from her.&nbsp; That
dark, horrid man of the plaza&mdash;would she have offered him a
cake had she been going to walk with him in the gloom of the
morning?&nbsp; After that little had been spoken between
us.&nbsp; She walked by my side with her accustomed smile; but
she had, as I flattered myself, begun to learn that I was not to
be won by a meaningless good nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are lucky in
our morning for the view!&rdquo; that was all she said, speaking
with that peculiarly clear, but slow pronunciation which she had
assumed in learning our language.</p>
<p>We entered the cathedral, and, walking the whole length of the
aisle, left it again at the porter&rsquo;s porch at the farther
end.&nbsp; Here we passed through a low door on to the stone
flight of steps, and at once began to ascend.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are a party of your countrymen up before us,&rdquo; said Maria;
&ldquo;the porter says that they went through the lodge half an
hour since.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they will return before we
are on the top,&rdquo; said I, bethinking myself of the task that
was before me.&nbsp; And indeed my heart was hardly at ease
within me, for that which I had to say would require all the
spirit of which I was master.</p>
<p>The ascent to the Giralda is very long and very fatiguing; and
we had to pause on the various landings and in the singular
belfry in order that Miss Daguilar might recruit her strength and
breath.&nbsp; As we rested on one of these occasions, in a
gallery which runs round the tower below the belfry, we heard a
great noise of shouting, and a clattering of sticks among the
bells.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the party of your countrymen who went
up before us,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity that
Englishmen should always make so much noise!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then she spoke in Spanish to the custodian of the bells, who is
usually to be found in a little cabin up there within the
tower.&nbsp; &ldquo;He says that they went up shouting like
demons,&rdquo; continued Maria; and it seemed to me that she
looked as though I ought to be ashamed of the name of an
Englishman.&nbsp; &ldquo;They may not be so solemn in their
demeanour as Spaniards,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;but, for all
that, there may be quite as much in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We then again began to mount, and before we had ascended much
farther we passed my three countrymen.&nbsp; They were young men,
with gray coats and gray trousers, with slouched hats, and
without gloves.&nbsp; They had fair faces and fair hair, and
swung big sticks in their hands, with crooked handles.&nbsp; They
laughed and talked loud, and, when we met them, seemed to be
racing with each other; but nevertheless they were
gentlemen.&nbsp; No one who knows by sight what an English
gentleman is, could have doubted that; but I did acknowledge to
myself that they should have remembered that the edifice they
were treading was a church, and that the silence they were
invading was the cherished property of a courteous people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all just the same as big boys,&rdquo; said
Maria.&nbsp; The colour instantly flew into my face, and I felt
that it was my duty to speak up for my own countrymen.&nbsp; The
word &ldquo;boys&rdquo; especially wounded my ears.&nbsp; It was
as a boy that she treated me; but, on looking at that befringed
young Spanish Don&mdash;who was not, apparently, my elder in
age&mdash;she had recognised a man.&nbsp; However, I said nothing
further till I reached the summit.&nbsp; One cannot speak with
manly dignity while one is out of breath on a staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, John,&rdquo; she said, stretching her hands away
over the fair plain of the Guadalquivir, as soon as we stood
against the parapet; &ldquo;is not that lovely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would not deign to notice this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;I think that you are too hard upon my
countrymen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too hard! no; for I love them.&nbsp; They are so good
and industrious; and come home to their wives, and take care of
their children.&nbsp; But why do they make themselves
so&mdash;so&mdash;what the French call gauche?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good and industrious, and come home to their
wives!&rdquo; thought I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you hardly
understand us as yet,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our
domestic virtues are not always so very prominent; but, I
believe, we know how to conduct ourselves as gentlemen: at any
rate, as well as Spaniards.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was very
angry&mdash;not at the faults, but at the good qualities imputed
to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In affairs of business, yes,&rdquo; said Maria, with a
look of firm confidence in her own opinion&mdash;that look of
confidence which she has never lost, and I pray that she may
never lose it while I remain with her&mdash;&ldquo;but in the
little intercourses of the world, no!&nbsp; A Spaniard never
forgets what is personally due either to himself or his
neighbours.&nbsp; If he is eating an onion, he eats it as an
onion should be eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such matters as that he is very grand, no
doubt,&rdquo; said I, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should you not eat an onion properly,
John?&nbsp; Now, I heard a story yesterday from Don&mdash;about
two Englishmen, which annoyed me very much.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did
not exactly catch the name of the Don in question but I felt
through every nerve in my body that it was the man who had been
talking to her on the plaza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have they done?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it is the same everywhere.&nbsp; We are always abused;
but, nevertheless, no people are so welcome.&nbsp; At any rate,
we pay for the mischief we do.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was angry with
myself the moment the words were out of my mouth, for, after all,
there is no feeling more mean than that pocket-confidence with
which an Englishman sometimes swaggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no mischief done in this case,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was simply that two men have made
themselves ridiculous for ever.&nbsp; The story is all about
Seville, and, of course, it annoys me that they should be
Englishmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Marquis D&rsquo;Almavivas was coming up to Seville
in the boat, and they behaved to him in the most outrageous
manner.&nbsp; He is here now and is going to give a series of
f&ecirc;tes.&nbsp; Of course he will not ask a single
Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall manage to live even though the Marquis
D&rsquo;Almavivas may frown upon us,&rdquo; said I, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the richest, and also the best of our
noblemen,&rdquo; continued Maria; &ldquo;and I never heard of
anything so absurd as what they did to him.&nbsp; It made me
blush when Don &mdash; told me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Don Tom&agrave;s, I
thought she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he be the best of your noblemen, how comes it that
he is angry because he has met two vulgar men?&nbsp; It is not to
be supposed that every Englishman is a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry!&nbsp; Oh, no! he was not angry; he enjoyed the
joke too much for that.&nbsp; He got completely the best of them,
though they did not know it; poor fools!&nbsp; How would your
Lord John Russell behave if two Spaniards in an English railway
carriage were to pull him about and tear his clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would give them in charge to a policeman, of
course,&rdquo; said I, speaking of such a matter with the
contempt it deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that were done here your ambassador would be
demanding national explanations.&nbsp; But Almavivas did much
better;&mdash;he laughed at them without letting them know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you mean that they took hold of him violently,
without any provocation?&nbsp; They must have been
drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, they were sober enough.&nbsp; I did not see it,
so I do not quite know exactly how it was, but I understand that
they committed themselves most absurdly, absolutely took hold of
his coat and tore it, and&mdash;; but they did such ridiculous
things that I cannot tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet Don
Tom&agrave;s, if that was the man&rsquo;s name, had been able to
tell her, and she had been able to listen to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What made them take hold of the marquis?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curiosity, I suppose,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He dresses somewhat fancifully, and they could not
understand that any one should wear garments different from their
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; But even then the blow did not strike home upon
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not pretty to look down upon the quiet
town?&rdquo; she said, coming close up to me, so that the skirt
of her dress pressed me, and her elbow touched my arm.&nbsp; Now
was the moment I should have asked her how her heart stood
towards me; but I was sore and uncomfortable, and my destiny was
before me.&nbsp; She was willing enough to let these English
faults pass without further notice, but I would not allow the
subject I drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find out who these men were,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and learn the truth of it.&nbsp; When did it
occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Thursday, I think he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that was the day we came up in the boat, Johnson
and myself.&nbsp; There was no marquis there then, and we were
the only Englishmen on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on Thursday, certainly, because it was well
known in Seville that he arrived on that day.&nbsp; You must have
remarked him because he talks English perfectly&mdash;though
by-the-bye, these men would go on chattering before him about
himself as though it were impossible that a Spaniard should know
their language.&nbsp; They are ignorant of Spanish, and they
cannot bring themselves to believe that any one should be better
educated than themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the blow had fallen, and I straightway appreciated the
necessity of returning immediately to Clapham where my family
resided, and giving up for ever all idea of Spanish
connections.&nbsp; I had resolved to assert the full strength of
my manhood on that tower, and now words had been spoken which
left me weak as a child.&nbsp; I felt that I was shivering, and
did not dare to pronounce the truth which must be made
known.&nbsp; As to speaking of love, and signifying my pleasure
that Don Tom&agrave;s should for the future be kept at a
distance, any such effort was quite beyond me.&nbsp; Had Don
Tom&agrave;s been there, he might have walked off with her from
before my face without a struggle on my part.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I
remember about it,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I think he must
have been in the boat on Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that I remember,&rdquo; I replied, turning away
to hide my embarrassment, &ldquo;he was there.&nbsp; Your friend
down below in the plaza seems to have made out a grand
story.&nbsp; No doubt he is not fond of the English.&nbsp; There
was such a man there, and I did take hold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, was it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Donna Maria, it was I; and if Lord John Russell
were to dress himself in the same way&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But I
had no time to complete my description of what might occur under
so extravagantly impossible a combination of circumstances, for
as I was yet speaking, the little door leading out on to the
leads of the tower was opened and my friend, the mayo of the
boat, still bearing gewgaws on his back, stepped up on to the
platform.&nbsp; My eye instantly perceived that the one pendule
was still missing from his jacket.&nbsp; He did not come alone,
but three other gentlemen followed him, who, however, had no
peculiarities in their dress.&nbsp; He saw me at once and bowed
and smiled; and then observing Donna Maria, he lifted his cap
from his head, and addressing himself to her in Spanish, began to
converse with her as though she were an old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Maria, after the first words
of greeting had been spoken between them; &ldquo;you must permit
me to present to you my father&rsquo;s most particular friend,
and my own,&mdash;Mr. Pomfret; John, this is the Marquis
D&rsquo;Almavivas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot now describe the grace with which this introduction
was effected, or the beauty of her face as she uttered the
word.&nbsp; There was a boldness about her as though she had
said, &ldquo;I know it all&mdash;the whole story.&nbsp; But, in
spite of that you must take him on my representation, and be
gracious to him in spite of what he has done.&nbsp; You must be
content to do that; or in quarrelling with him you must quarrel
with me also.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was done at the spur of the
moment&mdash;without delay.&nbsp; She, who not five minutes since
had been loudly condemning the unknown Englishman for his
rudeness, had already pardoned him, now that he was known to be
her friend; and had determined that he should be pardoned by
others also or that she would share his disgrace.&nbsp; I
recognised the nobleness of this at the moment; but,
nevertheless, I was so sore that I would almost have preferred
that she should have disowned me.</p>
<p>The marquis immediately lifted his cap with his left hand
while he gave me his right.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have already had the
pleasure of meeting this gentleman,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we had
some conversation in the boat together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, pointing to his rent, &ldquo;and
you still bear the marks of our encounter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it not delightful, Donna Maria,&rdquo; he
continued, turning to her; &ldquo;your friend&rsquo;s friend took
me for a torero?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it served you properly, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said
Donna Maria, laughing, &ldquo;you have no right to go about with
all those rich ornaments upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! quite properly; indeed, I make no complaint; and I
must beg your friend to understand, and his friend also, how
grateful I am for their solicitude as to my pecuniary
welfare.&nbsp; They were inclined to be severe on me for being so
extravagant in such trifles.&nbsp; I was obliged to explain that
I had no wife at home kept without her proper allowance of
dresses, in order that I might be gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are foreigners, and you should forgive their
error,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in token that I do so,&rdquo; said the marquis,
&ldquo;I shall beg your friend to accept the little ornament
which attracted his attention.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so saying, he
pulled the identical button out of his pocket, and gracefully
proffered it to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall carry it about with me always,&rdquo; said I,
accepting it, &ldquo;as a memento of humiliation.&nbsp; When I
look at it, I shall ever remember the folly of an Englishman and
the courtesy of a Spaniard;&rdquo; and as I made the speech I
could not but reflect whether it might, under any circumstances,
be possible that Lord John Russell should be induced to give a
button off his coat to a Spaniard.</p>
<p>There were other civil speeches made, and before we left the
tower the marquis had asked me to his parties, and exacted from
me an unwilling promise that I would attend them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he said, bowing again to Maria,
&ldquo;would, he was sure, grace them.&nbsp; She had done so on
the previous year; and as I had accepted his little present I was
bound to acknowledge him as my friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this was
very pretty, and of course I said that I would go, but I had not
at that time the slightest intention of doing so.&nbsp; Maria had
behaved admirably; she had covered my confusion, and shown
herself not ashamed to own me, delinquent as I was; but, not the
less, had she expressed her opinion, in language terribly strong,
of the awkwardness of which I had been guilty, and had shown
almost an aversion to my English character.&nbsp; I should leave
Seville as quickly as I could, and should certainly not again put
myself in the way of the Marquis D&rsquo;Almavivas.&nbsp; Indeed,
I dreaded the moment that I should be first alone with her, and
should find myself forced to say something indicative of my
feelings&mdash;to hear something also indicative of 
feelings.&nbsp; I had come out this morning resolved to demand my
rights and to exercise them&mdash;and now my only wish was to run
away.&nbsp; I hated the marquis, and longed to be alone that I
might cast his button from me.&nbsp; To think that a man should
be so ruined by such a trifle!</p>
<p>We descended that prodigious flight without a word upon the
subject, and almost without a word at all.&nbsp; She had carried
herself well in the presence of Almavivas, and had been too proud
to seem ashamed of her companion; but now, as I could well see,
her feelings of disgust and contempt had returned.&nbsp; When I
begged her not to hurry herself, she would hardly answer me; and
when she did speak, her voice was constrained and unlike
herself.&nbsp; And yet how beautiful she was!&nbsp; Well, my
dream of Spanish love must be over.&nbsp; But I was sure of this;
that having known her, and given her my heart, I could never
afterwards share it with another.</p>
<p>We came out at last on the dark, gloomy aisle of the
cathedral, and walked together without a word up along the side
of the choir, till we came to the transept.&nbsp; There was not a
soul near us, and not a sound was to be heard but the distant,
low pattering of a mass, then in course of celebration at some
far-off chapel in the cathedral.&nbsp; When we got to the
transept Maria turned a little, as though she was going to the
transept door, and then stopped herself.&nbsp; She stood still;
and when I stood also, she made two steps towards me, and put her
hand on my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, John!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;after all it does
not signify.&nbsp; You can make a joke of it when my back is
turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest John!&rdquo;&mdash;she had never spoken to me
in that way before&mdash;&ldquo;you must not be angry with
me.&nbsp; It is better that we should explain to each other, is
it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, much better.&nbsp; I am very glad you heard of it
at once.&nbsp; I do not look at it quite in the same light that
you do; but nevertheless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; But I know you are angry with
me.&nbsp; And yet you cannot think that I intended those words
for you.&nbsp; Of course I know now that there was nothing rude
in what passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but there was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am sure there was not.&nbsp; You could not be
rude though you are so free hearted.&nbsp; I see it all now, and
so does the marquis.&nbsp; You will like him so much when you
come to know him.&nbsp; Tell me that you won&rsquo;t be cross
with me for what I have said.&nbsp; Sometimes I think that I have
displeased you, and yet my whole wish has been to welcome you to
Seville, and to make you comfortable as an old friend.&nbsp;
Promise me that you will not be cross with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cross with her!&nbsp; I certainly had no intention of being
cross, but I had begun to think that she would not care what my
humour might be.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; I said, taking hold
of her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, John, do not do that.&nbsp; It is in the church,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria, will you answer me a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, very slowly, looking dawn upon
the stone slabs beneath our feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do you love me?&nbsp; You were to give me an
answer here, in Seville, and now I ask for it.&nbsp; I have
almost taught myself to think that it is needless to ask; and now
this horrid mischance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said she, speaking very
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this miserable blunder about the marquis&rsquo;s
button!&nbsp; After that I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marquis!&nbsp; Oh, John, is that to make a
difference between you and me?&mdash;a little joke like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a change between us!&mdash;such a thing as
that!&nbsp; Oh, John!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, Maria, what am I to hope?&nbsp; If you
will say that you can love me, I shall care nothing for the
marquis.&nbsp; In that case I can bear to be laughed
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will dare to laugh at you?&nbsp; Not the marquis,
whom I am sure you will like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend in this plaza, who told you of all
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, poor Tom&agrave;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know about his being poor.&nbsp; I mean the
gentleman who was with you last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom&agrave;s.&nbsp; You do not know who he
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How droll!&nbsp; He is your own clerk&mdash;partly your
own, now that you are one of the firm.&nbsp; And, John, I mean to
make you do something for him; he is such a good fellow; and last
year he married a young girl whom I love&mdash;oh, almost like a
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do something for him!&nbsp; Of course I would.&nbsp; I
promised, then and there, that I would raise his salary to any
conceivable amount that a Spanish clerk could desire; which
promise I have since kept, if not absolutely to the letter, at
any rate, to an extent which has been considered satisfactory by
the gentleman&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Maria&mdash;dearest Maria&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, John, we are in the church; and poor papa
will be waiting breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need hardly continue the story further.&nbsp; It will be
known to all that my love-suit throve in spite of my unfortunate
raid on the button of the Marquis D&rsquo;Almavivas, at whose
series of f&ecirc;tes through that month I was, I may boast, an
honoured guest.&nbsp; I have since that had the pleasure of
entertaining him in my own poor house in England, and one of our
boys bears his Christian name.</p>
<p>From that day in which I ascended the Giralda to this present
day in which I write, I have never once had occasion to complain
of a deficiency of romance either in Maria Daguilar or in Maria
Pomfret.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
